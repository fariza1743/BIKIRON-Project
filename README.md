# BIKIRON-Project
BIKIRON, an engineering project competition, was organised by SREDA (Sustainable and Renewable Energy Development Authority), Bangladesh back in 2021. We took part in this competition as a team named "KiNamDibo"and introduced our project for Smart Village. 
In this project, we integrated sensors with arduino UNO to record the measurement of soil chemicals, humidity and temperature. These records were kept and transmitted to the farmers'mobile phone as SMS using 2G module (GSM Module). This solution also gave recommendation about the type of plants that best fit the soil. We were very excited to finally get the opportunity to device our idea and present it although we had some limitations.
